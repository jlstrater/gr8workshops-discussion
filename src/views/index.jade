                We offer free or low-cost weekend courses for teaching Groovy or related technologies.  Our audience includes
                beginners with no experience coding before.  In Minneapolis, co-founder Allison leads that course.
                She starts with basic html and css and works up to a basic grails application.
                I lead a course for experienced developers looking to learn new languages and/or technologies.
                I like to teach that as a one-day course with different modules from different local experts.
                In the past, this has included my module, Groovy as a Scripting Language. We have also had Functional Programming concepts in Groovy,
                Intro to Grails, and TDD with Spock.
                This program is entirely run by volunteers who we recruit from local user groups including GUM(Groovy Users of Minnesota).
                I hope to have the next workshop in Spring of this year in Minneapolis, MN.  If you are interested in helping or running a Gr8Workshop
                of your own, please contact me.
